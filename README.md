# QAP1_SDAT_Gerald_Bartlett This is a QAP for my Test Driven Development course.
These tests veryify the functionality of the code which makes certain that the code does what it is supposed to do.

The Claculator Class I used the program we started in SDAT (Software Development & Testing) class. This was my first try at TDD so I needed somewhere to start 
I expanded on the addition & subtraction to include multiplication, division, to find if a number is a sqare of another & to find the square root of a given number.

For the CircleSphere Class I used a program that we did in Adavnced Java class but I modified it from a circle to sphere.
So I used the TDD to verify the formulas for finding Area, Circumference & Volume.

I was only suposed to provide 2 classes but knowing the calculator class was started in class I decided it to be only fair to myself to add one more class
So I included the Password Class I verified via Boolean means (True / False) whether the password was a certain length, Capital letters, or Blank.
